    "Wwlcome back folks to another episode of The tutorial on OpenCV. Permit me to share with you a quick story.\n",
    "          Sometimes ago, my colleagues Tried to build a device using a gyrometer which could be used to write directly into a pc, the idea was to write on any surface and get corresponding results on the pc. Cool right, it's like writing instead of typing. Yes, they made the device, but on the day of the project defence, Dr Akintadec(one of the conducting lecturers) disagreed with the idea. he claimed that the gyroscope should have a point of origin on the (X,Y,Z) axis so the software backend can take reasonable measurements and convert to traces.\n",
    "    This eventually brings us to this quick trace project, Where we detect the colour of my object(PEN) and track it's movement."

Unless if you plan to track two objects of the same colour. In the next line, i prepare parameters required to construct a bounding circle on the object. The first is the radius and the xy co-ordinates, next i used cv2.Moments to obtain it's center.
